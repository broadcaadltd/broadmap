## 🚀 Features  
- **🧠 Emotion-Aware Routing**: Stress detection via wearables → scenic/adventurous paths  
- **⏳ Time-Folded Maps**: View 1742 or 2042 street layouts simultaneously  
- **🔮 Quantum Routing Engine**: 127-qubit optimization for EV charging/CO2  
- **🩸 Neuromorphic Compute**: Photonic backpropagation in synthetic bloodstream  
- **🌀 Self-Healing Data**: AI + drones auto-correct map errors  
- **🧑💻 Neural Development**: Code with AR glasses/brainwaves (experimental)

## 📦 Installation  

### Requirements  
- Python 3.10+  
- Docker + NVIDIA Container Toolkit  
- iOS/Android: Xcode 15+/Android Studio Giraffe  
- Quantum Sim: Qiskit/D-Wave Leap (optional)  
 
# Minimal install (classical mode)  
pip install broadmap-core  

# Full quantum-ar experience  
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/broadmap++/main  
cd broadmap++ && ./install.sh --with-quantum --with-ar  
```


# Developer setup (Dockerized)  
docker-compose -f quantum-dev.yml up  

🧭 Basic Usage
```bash
python
from broadmap import QuantumMap, TimeViewer  
# Initialize with hybrid engine  
m = QuantumMap(mode="quantum-classical",  
               privacy="zk-snarks")  

# Set route with mood analysis  
route = m.route(  
  start=(37.7749, -122.4194),  
  end=(34.0522, -118.2437),  
  mood_source="apple_watch"  
)  

# View 1849 Gold Rush trails  
with TimeViewer(m, year=1849):  
    m.show_layer("historical")  
```
## React Native Example:

javascript
```bash
<BroadmapARView  
  moodDetection={true}  
  quantumRouting={Platform.OS === 'ios'}>  
  <RoutePreview style={{height: '100%'}}/>  
</BroadmapARView>  
 ```

## 🌟 Advanced Usage
Quantum Routing
```bash
# AWS Braket integration  
from broadmap.quantum import DWaveOptimizer  

dw = DWaveOptimizer(region="us-west-2")  
route = dw.solve(  
    constraints=["co2<2kg", "charge_stations>=3"],  
    deadline="10min"  
)  
```
## AR Navigation

```bash
## HoloLens 2 development  
broadmap deploy --ar hololens --scene underground  

# Voice-controlled exploration  
say "Broadmap: show 2040 climate projection"  
```
